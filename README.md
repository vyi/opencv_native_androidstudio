Native OpenCV with Android Studio
=================================

This application is a sample Android Studio project with native OpenCV.

It gets the camera frames, make JNI calls with its gray matrices references as parameters, add some random noise to the images from a C++ method, and render the generated frames.

It works with Android Studio 4

Last included OpenCV version: 3.4.11



Usage
-----

Here is how to use this project to run native OpenCV code.

* Make sure you have Android SDK up to date, with NDK installed and CMake
* Download latest OpenCV SDK for Android from OpenCV.org and decompress the zip file.
* Clone this project
* Create a directory `cmakeLibs` in `app/src/main` and place inside it `YOUR_OPENCV_SDK/sdk/native/libs`. This was done to address [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62088079/)
* In `app/CMakeLists.txt` change line 9 to points to `YOUR_OPENCV_SDK/sdk/native/jni/include`
* Sync gradle
* Run the application


How to create the native OpenCV project from scratch
----------------------------------------------------

Here is how I made this project. If you simply want to run openCV with NDK support, use the previous **Usage** chapter. If you want to build the full project from scratch, you can follow the steps in this chapter.

* Make sure you have Android SDK up to date, with NDK installed
* Download latest OpenCV SDK for Android from OpenCV.org and decompress the zip file.

* Create a new Android Studio project
  * Check Include C++ Support
  * Choose empty Activity
  * In C++ Support, you can check -fexceptions and -frtti

* Import OpenCV library module
  * New -> Import Module
  * Choose the `YOUR_OPENCV_SDK/sdk/java` folder
  * Unckeck replace jar, unckeck replace lib, unckeck create gradle-style

* Set the OpenCV library module up to fit your SDK

  Edit `openCVLibrary/build.gradle` to fit your SDK:

  ```
    compileSdkVersion 30
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 26
        targetSdkVersion 30
    }
  ```

* Add OpenCV module dependency in your app module

  File -> Project structure -> Module app -> Dependencies tab -> New module dependency -> choose OpenCV library module


* Make a symlink named `jniLibs` in `app/src/main` that points to `YOUR_OPENCV_SDK/sdk/native/libs`

* Set the app build.gradle
  * Add abiFilters
    ```
        externalNativeBuild {
            cmake {
                cppFlags "-frtti -fexceptions"
                abiFilters 'x86', 'x86_64', 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a'
            }
        }
    ```

  * Add openCV jniLibs directory to point to the symlink
    ```
    sourceSets {
        main {
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['src/main/jniLibs']
        }
    }
    ```
  See [build.gradle](app/build.gradle)

* Configure the `CMakeLists.txt` file
  * After the `cmake_minimum_required`, add

    ```
    include_directories(YOUR_OPENCV_SDK/sdk/native/jni/include)
    add_library( lib_opencv SHARED IMPORTED )
    set_target_properties(lib_opencv PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main/jniLibs/${ANDROID_ABI}/libopencv_java3.so)
    ```

  * At the end of the file add `lib_opencv` to the `target_link_libraries` list


* Grant camera permission
  * Add the following lines in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file

    ```
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.front"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.front.autofocus"/>
    ```

* Add OpenCV code
  * [MainActivity.java](app/src/main/java/ch/hepia/iti/opencvnativeandroidstudio/MainActivity.java)
  * [activity_main.xml](app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml)
  * [native-lib.cpp](app/src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp)
